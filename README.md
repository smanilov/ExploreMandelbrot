ExploreMandelbrot
=================

Intro
-----

ExploreMandelbrot is a personal project that I started during my exam session of May 2011. It is a sandbox for experimenting with different concepts like anti-aliasing, random-order rendering, multithreading synchronization, etc.

It is public now with the hope that it will be useful to you too.
